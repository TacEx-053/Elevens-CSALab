2.1: Explain in your own words the relationship between a deck and a card.

        A card is part of the deck while a deck contains all of the cards. With
        the is-a test: a deck is a card but a card is not a deck.

2.2: Consider the deck initialized with the statements below. How many cards 
     does the deck contain?

        The constructor will loop until all ranks have been assigned all suits.
        After the constructor is finished there will be 6 cards.

2.3: Specify the contents of theranks,suits,andpointValuesarrays so that the 
     deck constructor call initializes a deck for a Twenty-One game.

        String[] ranks = {"A", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "10",
                          "J", "Q", "K"}
        String[] suits = {"Diamonds", "Hearts", "Clubs", "Spades"}
        int[] pointValues = {11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10}

2.4: Does the order of elements of theranks,suits,andpointValuesarrays matter?

        The order of the ranks and pointValues have to sorrospond so cards 
        have the correct point values but the order of suits does not matter.
